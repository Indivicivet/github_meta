 links to my other things in github, especially github pages

- https://indivicivet.github.io/tone_sequence_trainer -- a trainer web app for Mandarin tones
- https://indivicivet.github.io/toki_pona/ -- pictures of words in toki pona (a minimalist) conlang)
- https://indivicivet.github.io/ -- this page! contains links to things, as you can see. (this may become inaccurate if I decide I have a more interesting thing to host on my root directory...)
- https://github.com/indivicivet -- in case you are lost and want to go see the repos
